Abstract

129Xe NMR spectra of natural abundant xenon gas trapped in fully dehydrated mesoporous materials  with  pore  sizes  smaller  than  2  nm  in  diameter  were  observed  under  atmospheric pressure in the temperature range between 168 and 373 K.  The average pore diameters of the materials studied in this paper were 0.5, 1 and about 2 nm for molecular sieves 5A and 13X and synthesized mesoporous silica, respectively. The samples were fully dehydrated using an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system and xenon gas was introduced with the sample pre-cooled to 168 K just above the boiling point of xenon. The  129Xe NMR spectra were observed as a function of increasing temperature and the 129Xe shift were observed at each temperature for the three samples under atmospheric pressure. The behaviors of xenon atoms in small pores observed in equilibrium states can provide important information on relationships between the pore structure and 129Xe chemical shift.

1. Introduction

129Xe Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is one of the important methods to measure the pore  diameters  and  interactions  between  trapped  species  and  the  innerwall  of  the  pores  [1]. This technique has been applied to probe porosity of mesoporous silica and the pore size is known to relate with the chemical shift [2]. Since the Van der Waals radius of Xe is known to be 0.216 nm, the possible pore size to adsorb xenon should be larger than 0.4 nm in diameter. Then the mean pore diameters ranging from 0.4 to 300 nm are the possible target to show the relationship experimentally. We have tried to apply it to a self-assembled porous silica sample (Lowk1), which is known as a candidate of low-dielectric constant materials for interconnects in  future  ultra-large  scale  integrated  circuits  (ULSIs)[3].  The  development  of  porous  silica suitable for this purpose is to obtain a low-dielectric constant and a high mechanical strength.

2. Method and Materials

The self-assembled porous silica sample was prepared from acidic silica sol mixed with the cationic  template  of  cetyltrimethylammonium  chloride  [3].  Metal  impurities  in  the  sample were minimized by using the electronic-grade silica sol. The sample was fine powder and the amount  of  the  fully  degassed  sample  was  ~  0.27  g.  Molecular  sieves  of  5A  and  13X  were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. as pellet and the fully degassed sample of 0.39 and 0.30 g of 5A and 13X were used, respectively. Fully dehydrated samples were prepared as follows. The sample was put in a 10-mm NMR sample tube and connected to a vacuum line, gradually evacuated and then the temperature was increased to 200  oC and kept over 1 week until the pressure became below 5 x 10-6 Pa by an ultra-high vacuum system (UHV) on a Varian V70 turbo molecular pump.

The  sample  temperature  was  set  below  168  K  before  the  introduction  of  the  xenon  gas under  vacuum.  The  room-temperature  xenon  gas  was  introduced  into  evacuated  samples  of the porous silica, the thermally polarized  129Xe NMR signal was then observed after placing in the sample in a high field magnet. The temperature was gradually increased without further addition of xenon gas. The 129Xe NMR spectra were measured by a Tecmag Apollo equipped by a wide-bore 6.3 T SCM at the frequency of 74.7 MHz. The 90o pulse width was 30 μs. The spin-lattice relaxation time T1 was found to be short for the 5A and 13X. Each spectrum was observed with 64 accumulations at 90o pulse with 2 s repetition time. Since the longest T1 of 129Xe in 5A and 13X was ~ 0.35 s, the magnetization was fully recovered at each scan. The tuning of the probe was adjusted at every temperature because of the wide temperature range observation. Before measuring at each temperature, the sample was kept at least 30 m. Since the T1 of Lowk1 is much longer compared with 5A and 13X, the measuring conditions were varied to obtain reasonable S/N spectra as following; at 173 K, 45o pulse, repetition time 10 s, 40 accumulations, at 213 K, 45o pulse, repetition time 12 s, 40 accumulations, at 273 K, 60o pulse, repetition time 20 s, 80 accumulations, and at 333 K, 60o pulse, repetition time 120 s and 320 accumulations.

3. Results and Discussion

The  measurements  of  129Xe  NMR  spectra  were  started  from  173  K  and  the  number  of xenon atoms decreased as the temperature increased. The 129Xe NMR spectra for Lowk1 are shown in Figures 1. The observed changes were continuous in the spectra for 5A owing to the temperature increase; these changes were decreases in signal intensity and line width, and an increase  in  field  shift.  On  the  other  hand,  the  129Xe  spectral  patterns  for  13X  varied  in  a different manner. The signal intensity and position of 13X changed similarly to those of 5A until  223  K,  and  then  the  signal  became  narrower  between  233  and  263  K,  and  the  signal intensity decreased above 323 K. The 129Xe spectrum of Lowk1 at 173 K showed an intense signal and was observed by one scan until 213 K, as shown in Figure 1, yielding quantitative peak  areas.  As  the  temperature  increased,  the  signal  became  broader  and  the  accumulations were  necessary  to  obtain  a  reasonable  signal-to-noise  ratio.  The  129Xe  peaks  moved  to  high fields as the temperature increased and temperature dependences of the 129Xe shift referred to as the gas signal are shown in Figure 2.

As shown in Figure 2, the 129Xe NMR shift of 291 ppm for xenon confined in 5A at 168 K in  the  present  study  is  very  close  to  that  for  liquid  xenon  in  free  space.  As  the  temperature increased,  the  ratio  of  xenon  confined  in  pores  of  5A  decreases  relative  to  the  gas  in  free space  decreased  owing  to  adsorbed  and  gas  phase  equilibrium.  The  129Xe  shift  moved  to  a higher  field  because  of  the  larger  contribution  of  xenon  in  free  space  or  the  decrease  in  the residence time and/or number of xenon atoms inside the pore. The xenon atoms trapped in the 5A pores at 173 K gradually moved to free space as the temperature increased. The residence time and number of xenon atoms in the pores decreased exponentially, and also the 129Xe shift

moved  to  the  higher  field  side  exponentially.  The  129Xe  shift  can  be  assumed  to  be proportional  to  the  number  of  resident  xenon  atoms  in  the  5A  pores  under  atmospheric pressure.

The pore diameter of 13X is designed to be larger than that of 5A and is about 1 nm. The possible number of xenon atoms that enter a 13X pore is two. At 168 K the 13X can trap two xenon atoms in a pore and with the temperature increase, a xenon atom moved to free space. The  xenon  gas  in  the  13X  pore  can  move  more  freely  in  a  wider  space  than  that  in  the  5A pore.  The  temperature-dependent  shift  of  129Xe  NMR  for  the  molecular  sieves  5A  and  13X under  atmospheric  pressure  can  be  interpreted  consistently  by  adsorbed  and  gas  phase equilibrium.

Different  from  the  molecular  sieves,  (1)  Lowk1  contains  no  high-concentration paramagnetic  metal  impurities  and  (2)  its  pores  are  two-dimensional  hexagonally  ordered cylindrical and about 2 nm in diameter. The 129Xe shift of Lowk1 at 168 K showed a field (15 ppm)  slightly  higher  than  that  of  13X,  and  the  differences  increased  as  the  temperature increased  (about  60  ppm  between  233  and  283  K)  and  again  decreased.  Above  353  K,  the 129Xe shifts of 13X and Lowk1 were coincident. Since the pore diameters of Lowk1 is larger than that of 13X, the number of xenon atoms absorbed in the Lowk1 pores should decrease faster as the temperature increases. The steeper decrease in 129Xe shift (higher field shift) with the temperature corresponds to the quicker decrease in the number of resident xenon atoms in the  Lowk1  pores  between  183  and  253  K.  The  number  of  resident  xenon  atoms  decreased gradually as the temperature increased above 260 K.

4. Conclusions

A 129Xe NMR study on mesoporous materials under atmospheric pressure has been carried out. The combined use of UHV treatment and 129Xe NMR techniques at atmospheric pressure enables  the  estimation  of  the  size  and  distribution  of  pores  by  chemical  shift  measurement. The  present  method  proposed  for  the  evaluation  of  nanoparticles,  permselective  membranes and mesoporous materials for achieving low-dielectric constant is efficient in determining the overall pore structures of whole samples in addition to the local structures.
